##### Abstract 


We collect a Richly Annotated Pedestrian (RAP) dataset from multi-camera surveillance scenarios for pedestrian attribute analysis. The RAP has in total 41,585 pedestrian samples, each of which is annotated with 72 attributes as well as viewpoints, occlusions, body parts information. To our knowledge, the RAP is current largest pedestrian attribute dataset, which is expected to promote the study of large-sclae attribute recognition systems.


##### Dataset Information

- The basic annotation information on RAP dataset can be seen from the Table 1.


- To have a clear understanding about the annotation, some attributes are shown in Figure 1 according to the class which is shown in Table 1.

- In real scene, attribute will change or be hard to determine due to camera viewpoint, body part occlusion, human's orientation and pose, time range, image qualiry etc. Even the same person's attribute will change a lot, which make it a challenge problem. Examples of different attributes on the same person in RAP dataset are shown in Figure 2.

- The RAP dataset provides rough annotation about body parts, including head-shoulder, uppper body and lower body. Accurate annotation on part position is hard in that the image quality is not good in real surveillance scenarios. The part anontation examples are shown in Figure 3.

- Viewpoints and Occlusion are two important research topics in visual recogniton tasks. The RAP dataset provides the annotation on these two factors. The distribution of viewpoints and occlusion positons in RAP are shown in Figure 4.


- For clear comparsion with existing person attribute dataset, the detail information about existing popular pedestrian attribute dataset has been shown in Table 2.
